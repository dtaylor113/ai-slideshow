# Digital Wallpaper Frame - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

A web-based digital frame that:
1. Displays your family photos as AI-generated artwork
2. Automatically selects artistic styles based on photo content
3. Provides seamless auto-rotating slideshow experience
4. (Future) Can be shared with family via public URL
5. Rediscovers forgotten memories through randomization
6. Ships with a curated `/photos` set that can be swapped for personal favorites

- ‚úÖ React frontend with auto-rotation
- ‚úÖ Random photo selection
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimalist interface
- ‚úÖ Single startup script

**Result:** Working local slideshow foundation!

---

## Phase 1-2: Development Foundation ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### What We Built
- ‚úÖ Project structure and tooling
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ Component architecture
- ‚úÖ API service layer
- ‚úÖ Development workflow

**Result:** Solid foundation for rapid iteration!

---

## Phase 3: AI Image Generation with Context-Aware Styles ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### Goal
Transform photos into AI-generated artwork with intelligent style selection.

### What We Built

#### **Core AI Pipeline**
- ‚úÖ Gemini 2.5 Flash vision analysis (2-3 sentence descriptions)
- ‚úÖ AI-powered prompt generation (context-aware art styles)
- ‚úÖ Gemini 2.5 Flash Image ("Nano Banana") for generation
- ‚úÖ Image optimization (800px analysis, 1024px generation)
- ‚úÖ All FREE using Gemini API!
- ‚úÖ Verbose (20‚Äì35 word) image prompts for richer, more descriptive generations

#### **Intelligent Style Selection**
- ‚úÖ Analysis-driven style choices
- ‚úÖ Adapts to photo content and mood
- ‚úÖ Varies between dozens of artistic styles
- ‚úÖ Examples:
  - Halloween ‚Üí Tim Burton gothic illustrations
  - Sports celebration ‚Üí Neon synthwave album covers
  - Beach sunset ‚Üí J.M.W. Turner atmospheric paintings
  - Nature ‚Üí Impressionist, watercolor, Japanese woodblock

#### **Slideshow Experience**
- ‚úÖ Seamless auto-rotation while new images are generating
- ‚úÖ Background processing while viewing current image
- ‚úÖ Natural pacing based on generation time, or timed cycles when generation is paused
- ‚úÖ Play/pause and speed controls for the curated slideshow (default 8s)
- ‚úÖ Footer shows next image progress:
  - "Next Image: Analysing..."
  - "Next Image: Creating image prompt..."
  - "Next Image: Generating image..."

#### **History & Navigation**
- ‚úÖ Left filmstrip showing the latest 200 images with thumbnails
- ‚úÖ Click any thumbnail to revisit with full metadata
- ‚úÖ Auto-managed storage (keeps last 200, deletes oldest)
- ‚úÖ Saves to `photos/generated/`

- ‚úÖ Minimalist full-screen design
- ‚úÖ Right panel: Analysis + Image Prompt display
- ‚úÖ Toggle between original and generated
- ‚úÖ Hover previews show generated art alongside the original photo
- ‚úÖ Active thumbnail highlighting
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions and loading states
- ‚úÖ Prompt details popup with scrollable template + generation sections (no slider fuss)
- ‚úÖ Admin settings gear (password `football`) gates image generation controls

### Technical Implementation

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET  /api/photos/random          # Random photo
POST /api/analyze                # Gemini vision analysis  
POST /api/prompt                 # AI style prompt generation
POST /api/generate               # Image generation
GET  /api/generated/history      # Last 200 images metadata
GET  /api/generated/{filename}   # Serve generated image
```

**Processing Flow:**
```
1. Fetch random photo from photos/
   ‚Üì
2. Gemini Vision analyzes (thumbnail 800px)
   ‚Üì
3. AI generates context-aware style prompt
   Examples:
   - "in the style of Tim Burton's gothic illustrations"
   - "as a vibrant Monet impressionist painting"
   - "in the dramatic style of Caravaggio"
   ‚Üì
4. Gemini Nano Banana generates image (1024px)
   ‚Üì
5. Save to photos/generated/
   ‚Üì
6. Display with metadata
   ‚Üì
7. Immediately start processing next in background
```

**Speed Optimizations:**
- Resize images before API calls (4-10x faster)
- Analysis uses 800px thumbnails (~2-3 seconds)
- Generation uses 1024px images (~15-20 seconds)
- Background processing = no waiting between images

### Milestone Achieved
‚úÖ **Working AI-powered digital frame with intelligent style selection!**

## Phase 4: Hosted Family Slideshow üéØ **COMPLETE**

### Goal
Deliver a hosted, view-only slideshow experience backed by curated generated art, while keeping image generation under admin control.

### What We Did
- [x] Ship hosted defaults: slideshow loads in view-only mode, generation disabled by default, footer controls hidden.
- [x] Add admin unlock workflow (password gate + start generation button) for controlled API usage.
- [x] Expose slideshow playback controls (play/pause + 3‚Äì30s speed selector, default 8s).
- [x] Track/deploy curated `photos/` + `photos/generated/` bundle so family sees finished art immediately.
- [x] Auto-prune missing generated images and show a clean loading state for thumbnails.
- [x] Randomize filmstrip + slideshow queue so viewers get fresh mixes and newly generated art appears within a few slides.
- [x] Polish kiosk UX: glass info badges, footer toggle, keyboard shortcuts, and persistent slideshow-only preference.
- [x] Add pin-to-original mode: pause slideshow, fetch every variation for the selected photo, then resume with the filtered gallery.

**Milestone:** Hosted URL shows an immediately-available slideshow; admin can selectively enable generation when desired.

## Decision Log

### Why Gemini API?
- **FREE tier** for both vision and generation
- Fast enough for real-time use (2-3s analysis, 15-20s generation)
- Good quality results
- No credit card required
- "Nano Banana" (gemini-2.5-flash-image) works great

### Why Context-Aware Styles?
- More interesting than single style
- Matches photo content naturally
- Creates variety in the slideshow
- Feels "smart" and personalized

### Why Background Processing?
- Natural pacing without arbitrary timers while generation runs
- When generation is paused, a short timer rotates the saved history
- Smooth user experience
- Always have next image ready
- Viewers get plenty of time with each image

### Why Filmstrip History?
- Easy to revisit favorites
- Shows what AI has created
- No need to re-generate
- Visual timeline of the session

### Why Local Storage First?
- Fastest path to working prototype
- No authentication complexity
- Easy iteration and testing
- Can add cloud storage later without breaking anything

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Cloud Storage:** S3 (simple) or Google Photos (auto-sync)?
2. **Deployment:** Railway (easiest) or self-hosted (more control)?
3. **Cost Budget:** $5-10/month okay for hosting + storage?
4. **Sharing:** Private link only, or add accounts for different families?

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Success ‚úÖ
- [x] Generates artwork from any photo
- [x] Styles match photo content
- [x] Seamless auto-rotation
- [x] Easy to revisit history
- [x] All FREE (no API costs yet!)

### Phase 4-5 Success (Next)
- [ ] Works with full photo library (1000s of photos)
- [ ] Accessible via public URL
- [ ] Family can view anytime
- [ ] Reliable and fast
- [ ] Under $10/month total cost
